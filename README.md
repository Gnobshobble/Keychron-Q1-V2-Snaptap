To activate or deactive the script, press fn + insert.
If you type an a and then a d too quickly you'll get a double press. 
If you fix it, create a PR, but otherwise I was too lazy to deal with it so you can just toggle the script off to type normally.
I'm assuming if you tracked down this github you can figure out how to flash a keyboard firmware but you will need QMK to apply the firmware changes.
Also, this will only work for the Keychron Q1 V2 but you can copy the code over to any of the other keyboard firmware options, you just may have to change the key codes.
